- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backwards compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` with date and changes
3. Commit changes with version tag
4. Create release with release notes

### Automated Versioning

Use the following npm scripts for version management:

```bash
npm run version:patch   # For bug fixes
npm run version:minor   # For new features
npm run version:major   # For breaking changes
```

Each command will:

- Bump the version number
- Update the changelog
- Create a git tag
- Push changes to repository
