## 🔄 Smart Redirect Handling

The system intelligently handles redirects to avoid duplicate testing:

1. **🕷️ Discovers** all pages through intelligent crawling
2. **📍 Detects** when a page redirects to another URL
3. **✅ Checks** if the redirect destination has already been tested
4. **⏭️ Skips** duplicate testing while tracking both original and final URLs
5. **📊 Reports** on actual tested pages with redirect information

**Example**: If `/old-page` redirects to `/new-page`, and `/new-page` was
already tested, the system will skip `/old-page` and mark it as processed,
saving time while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

## 📊 What It Does

1. **🕷️ Smart Site Crawling**: Automatically discovers up to 50 pages across
   your website (4 levels deep)
2. **🔄 Intelligent Redirect Handling**: Tests each unique page only once, even
   when redirects occur
3. **🌐 Chrome Browser Testing**: Optimised for Chrome/Chromium browser testing:
   - **Chrome Focus**: Comprehensive testing in Chrome browser for consistent
     results

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The accessibility testing system can be configured for any website using
environment variables:

```bash
# Site Configuration
TARGET_SITE_URL=https://your-website.com

# Crawling Performance (adjust based on website complexity)
MAX_PAGES=50                    # Maximum pages to discover (default: 50)
MAX_DEPTH=4                     # Maximum crawl depth (default: 4)
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=300      # Delay in ms between requests (default: 300)
MAX_RETRIES=3                   # Number of retries per page (default: 3)
RETRY_DELAY=1500                # Delay in ms between retries (default: 1500)
PAGE_TIMEOUT=20000              # Timeout in ms per page (default: 20000)

# Test Execution
FAIL_ON_CRITICAL_VIOLATIONS=true    # Fail the test if critical violations are found
MINIMUM_COMPLIANCE_THRESHOLD=80     # Set minimum compliance threshold (0-100%)
```

### Universal Timeout Strategy

The system uses an **adaptive timeout strategy** that works for any website:

1. **First attempt**: Fast loading (`domcontentloaded`) with base timeout
2. **Second attempt**: Full resource loading (`load`) with 1.3x timeout
3. **Third attempt**: Network idle (`networkidle`) with 1.6x timeout

This approach handles:

- **Fast static sites**: Quick first-attempt success
- **Complex web apps**: Progressive fallback to more patient loading
- **Single Page Apps**: Final networkidle attempt for dynamic content

### Configure for Different Website Types

**For fast static sites:**

```bash
PAGE_TIMEOUT=10000          # 10 seconds
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=200  # 200ms
MAX_RETRIES=2               # 2 retries
```

**For complex web applications:**

```bash
PAGE_TIMEOUT=30000          # 30 seconds
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=500  # 500ms
MAX_RETRIES=3               # 3 retries
```

**For very large sites:**

```bash
MAX_PAGES=100               # More pages
MAX_DEPTH=5                 # Deeper crawling
PAGE_TIMEOUT=45000          # 45 seconds
```

### Customise Target Website

The target website can be configured through environment variables or the CLI
tool. The system automatically adapts to any website without code changes
required.

### Custom Exclusion Patterns

The system includes universal exclusion patterns, but you can customise them
through the CLI tool's advanced configuration options.

### ⏱️ Comprehensive Coverage Settings

## 📋 Implementation Guidelines

### 🎯 **Getting Started (Next 2 Weeks)**

**Recommended order for immediate implementation:**

1. **CLI Cleanup Logic** (2-3 days)
   - File: `src/cli/accessibility-test-cli.ts`
   - Replace TODO at line 268 with actual cleanup implementation

2. **Tool Registration** (3-5 days)
   - File: `src/services/orchestration/parallel-analyzer.ts`
   - Complete tool registration at line 146

3. **UK Localisation** (2-3 days)
   - Global search and replace for US spellings
   - Update date/time formatting across all services

4. **Unit Test Coverage** (1 week)
   - Focus on new Phase 2 services
   - Add CLI functionality tests

### 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Phase 1**: All TODOs resolved, 90%+ test coverage, UK localisation complete
- **Phase 2**: <4GB memory usage, <30s analysis time, 99.9% uptime
- **Phase 3**: Multi-browser support, mobile testing, accessibility scoring
- **Phase 4**: Web dashboard, interactive reports, enhanced UX
- **Phase 5**: Containerised deployment, microservices architecture

### 🔧 **Technical Considerations**

- **UK Spelling**: Use British English throughout (colour, behaviour,
  organisation)
- **Timezone**: GMT/BST with DD/MM/YYYY date formats
- **Testing**: Update unit tests after every change
- **Documentation**: Update changelog for all changes
- **Legacy Code**: Remove old implementations when adding new features
