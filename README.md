## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Memory Constraints (RESOLVED)
The accessibility testing system has been optimised for Chrome-only testing due to memory constraints when running across multiple browsers. **Multi-browser testing can cause system crashes** due to the comprehensive nature of the accessibility analysis.

**Current Configuration:**
- ‚úÖ **Chrome-only Testing**: Stable and reliable
- ‚ùå **Multi-browser Testing**: Can cause memory issues and crashes
- ‚úÖ **Optimised Performance**: Reduced memory usage and improved stability

**Impact:**
- Testing is focused on Chrome/Chromium browser
- Results are representative of Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
- Memory usage is significantly reduced
- System stability is improved

### Process Hanging (RESOLVED)
Previously, the test runner would not exit cleanly after scans completed, requiring manual termination. This has been fixed with:

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Pa11y Timeout Control**: Reduced timeouts and added timeout racing to prevent hanging
- ‚úÖ **Process Cleanup**: Global teardown ensures all Chrome processes are terminated
- ‚úÖ **Test Timeouts**: Added global and per-test timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging
- ‚úÖ **Forced Exit**: Clean exit mechanism after test completion

**Benefits:**
- Tests now exit cleanly after completion
- No manual intervention required
- Improved CI/CD compatibility
- Better resource management

## üîÑ Smart Redirect Handling

The system intelligently handles redirects to avoid duplicate testing:

1. **üï∑Ô∏è Discovers** all pages through intelligent crawling
2. **üìç Detects** when a page redirects to another URL
3. **‚úÖ Checks** if the redirect destination has already been tested
4. **‚è≠Ô∏è Skips** duplicate testing while tracking both original and final URLs
5. **üìä Reports** on actual tested pages with redirect information

**Example**: If `/old-page` redirects to `/new-page`, and `/new-page` was
already tested, the system will skip `/old-page` and mark it as processed,
saving time while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

## üìä What It Does

1. **üï∑Ô∏è Smart Site Crawling**: Automatically discovers up to 25 pages across
   your website (3 levels deep)
2. **üîÑ Intelligent Redirect Handling**: Tests each unique page only once, even
   when redirects occur
3. **üåê Chrome Browser Testing**: Optimised for Chrome/Chromium browser testing:
   - **Chrome Focus**: Comprehensive testing in Chrome browser for consistent results
   - **Memory Optimised**: Single-browser testing reduces memory usage and prevents crashes
4. **üß™ Multi-Tool Testing**: Runs comprehensive accessibility analysis using
   multiple complementary tools:
   - **axe-core**: Industry-standard accessibility testing engine (violations
     with detailed remediation)
   - **Pa11y**: Command-line testing with HTML_CodeSniffer (additional coverage
     and different perspective)
   - **Combined Results**: Merges findings to eliminate gaps and provide broader
     WCAG 2.1 AA coverage
5. **üìÑ Professional Reports**: Creates detailed JSON and PDF reports with:
   - **Executive Summary** with overall compliance percentage
   - **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Matrix** with Pass/Fail/Not Assessed status for
     each criterion
   - **Most Common Violations** across the entire site with browser information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

The accessibility testing system can be configured for any website using environment variables:

```bash
# Site Configuration
TARGET_SITE_URL=https://your-website.com

# Crawling Performance (adjust based on website complexity)
MAX_PAGES=50                    # Maximum pages to discover (default: 50)
MAX_DEPTH=4                     # Maximum crawl depth (default: 4)
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=300      # Delay in ms between requests (default: 300)
MAX_RETRIES=3                   # Number of retries per page (default: 3)
RETRY_DELAY=1500                # Delay in ms between retries (default: 1500)
PAGE_TIMEOUT=20000              # Timeout in ms per page (default: 20000)

# Test Execution
FAIL_ON_CRITICAL_VIOLATIONS=true    # Fail the test if critical violations are found
MINIMUM_COMPLIANCE_THRESHOLD=80     # Set minimum compliance threshold (0-100%)
```

### Universal Timeout Strategy

The system uses an **adaptive timeout strategy** that works for any website:

1. **First attempt**: Fast loading (`domcontentloaded`) with base timeout
2. **Second attempt**: Full resource loading (`load`) with 1.3x timeout
3. **Third attempt**: Network idle (`networkidle`) with 1.6x timeout

This approach handles:
- **Fast static sites**: Quick first-attempt success
- **Complex web apps**: Progressive fallback to more patient loading
- **Single Page Apps**: Final networkidle attempt for dynamic content

### Configure for Different Website Types

**For fast static sites:**
```bash
PAGE_TIMEOUT=10000          # 10 seconds
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=200  # 200ms
MAX_RETRIES=2               # 2 retries
```

**For complex web applications:**
```bash
PAGE_TIMEOUT=30000          # 30 seconds
DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=500  # 500ms
MAX_RETRIES=3               # 3 retries
```

**For very large sites:**
```bash
MAX_PAGES=100               # More pages
MAX_DEPTH=5                 # Deeper crawling
PAGE_TIMEOUT=45000          # 45 seconds
```

### Customise Target Website

The target website can be configured through environment variables or the CLI tool. The system automatically adapts to any website without code changes required.

### Custom Exclusion Patterns

The system includes universal exclusion patterns, but you can customise them through the CLI tool's advanced configuration options.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Comprehensive Coverage Settings

The system prioritises **comprehensive coverage over speed** with these
settings:

- **Intelligent Pre-crawling**: Site crawled once and cached for 60 minutes
- **Test Timeout**: 30 minutes per browser (prioritises thoroughness)
